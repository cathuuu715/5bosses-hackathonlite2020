## Problem statement
“The COVID-19 Pandemic has made society more reliant on virtual health services. Given the sudden nature of the event, many of these services weren’t designed with the problems caused by the pandemic in mind and are consequently facing great difficulty. Come up with a product that improves or supports virtual health services.”

## Judging criteria

#### Effectiveness (15)

How well does the project tackle the goal? Will it completely solve the goal, make significant strides to achieve the goal, address a smaller (but still important) part of the goal, or just scratch the surface of the goal?

#### Viability/Feasibility (10)

If the project were to be rolled-out in the real world, how viable would it actuallybe? Would it be feasible in terms of time, cost & scale? Or is it a bit too idealistic to be implemented realistically? Once correctly implemented, what is the projected value of this solution? Can you show it in terms of the potential hours saved, cost reduced or revenue generated?

#### Social Impact (10)

What kind of social or business value could this product deliver? How does this project make the world a little bit better, and to positively impact people’s lives?

#### Originality (5)

Is the hack more than just another generic social/mobile/web/IoT solution? Does it do something entirely novel, or at least take a fresh approach to an old problem?

#### Presentation (5)

How effective was the presentation at conveying the team’s approach to their chosen goal? Was it easy to understand the problem domain and how exactly the project has taken steps in tackling it?
